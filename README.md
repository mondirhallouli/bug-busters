**Bug busters is an application for users to share problems with a community and get help with them. I is a sample CRUD application to showcase my capabilities of building a fullstack web app with authentication. I serves to display my ability to design and create a Node JS server using Express.js and managing user data using MongoDB, as well as React.js to build a frontend interface.**

4. make sure you have `nodemon` package installed
5. open a terminal window in the backend directory and run `npm run dev`
